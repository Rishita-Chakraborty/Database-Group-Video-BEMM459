# Database-Group-Video-BEMM459


🎥 Group Demo Video – BEMM459 Fraud Detection Project

This video demonstrates the working prototype of our group project for BEMM459:
📌 Fraud Detection in Global E-Commerce Platforms using Polyglot Persistence.

Key Features Covered in the Demo:

✅ MySQL Integration for structured transactional data (users, orders, fraud reports)

✅ MongoDB for unstructured behavioral data (login anomalies, session logs, reviews)

✅ Python-based fraud detection logic combining data from both databases

✅ Data visualizations: risk score distributions, device access patterns, and anomaly detection

✅ End-to-end execution with real-time analysis and results

The project leverages a polyglot architecture to enhance fraud detection across diverse data types, enabling scalable, multi-source analytics for platforms like Amazon.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Python (pymysql, pymongo, pandas, matplotlib)

MySQL (local instance)

MongoDB (local instance)

Jupyter Notebook

Zoom (for screen recording)

📂 This video is part of our final submission for the 2024/25 academic year at the University of Exeter.
